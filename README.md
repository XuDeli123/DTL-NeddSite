# DTL-NeddSite
DTL-NeddSite: Deep Transfer Learning Based Architecture for Lysine Neddylation Sites Prediction
# Datasets Description
We use experimentally validated human NEDD peptide data. Our procedure is designed to prepare benchmark datasets with high confidence for ten-fold cross-validation and independent tests
# Programming language
Python 3.8 and above
# Environment configuration information
All python packages and their corresponding version numbers required by the project are stored in tensorflow.yaml
# Using DTL-NeddSite to predict neddylation sites
step1: Find the predict.py file and locate the working directory to its parent directory<br>
step2: Specify the fasta file and run the predict.py file for prediction. Example command: python predict.py --file test.fasta<br>
step3: Finally, the prediction results will be saved in the Results folder
