# DTL-NeddSite
DTL-NeddSite: Deep Transfer Learning Based Architecture for Lysine Neddylation Sites Prediction
# Datasets Description
We provide positive and negative site data used in model training and testing.
# Programming language
Python 3.8 and above
# Environment configuration information
All python packages and their corresponding version numbers required by the project are stored in tensorflow.yaml
# Using DTL-NeddSite to predict neddylation sites
Step 1: Locate the predict.py file and set the working directory to its parent directory.  
Step 2: Specify the fasta file and execute the predict.py file for making predictions. Example command: `python predict.py --file test.fasta`  
Step 3: Once the execution is complete, the prediction results will be saved in the Results folder.
